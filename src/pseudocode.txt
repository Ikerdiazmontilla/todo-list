Dom:

    create functions:
        to display a task
        displayMainContent()




    Add event listener to each button and run the logic function and add active to the button, change after tasks text
    Figure out how to return all dialogs buttons
    If I display a project, add the + button 
    



Things to do:

Put display task in a function and change it everywhere
Add memory
Add colors depending on priority
